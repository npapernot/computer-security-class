# Malware

Sirefef is difficult to remove from a machine as it takes 
advantage of loopholes in the Windows OS:
* a signed program does not need to verify that the 
libraries themselves are signed
* firewall and anti-virus are disabled by the malware
* `sirefef` itself runs in stealth mode: no UI claims of
compromised machine
* `sirefef` bypasses the Windows API to make system calls
directly from DLLs
