# timing attacks

timing attacks are examples of side channel attacks

a possible defense is binding: ensure the computation always takes the same time

other side channel: analysis of power consumption.
a direct interpretation of power measurements can reveal
the instructions executed. 

threat model differs from previously: the hardware is not 
assumed to be trust worthy anymore
