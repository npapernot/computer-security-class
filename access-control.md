# Access control

restricting the operations that 
processes may perform on a system

access control is useful for: 
protection (prevent errors) and 
security (prevent unauthorized 
access under all conditions)

two dimensions: protecting the 
process (limit other access to 
your resources) and protecting
ressources from your process. 

security policy defines the rules: some
statement of secure procedure or configuration
that parameterizes the operation of a system.
