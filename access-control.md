# Access control

restricting the operations that 
processes may perform on a system

access control is useful for: 
protection (prevent errors) and 
security (prevent unauthorized 
access under all conditions)

two dimensions: protecting the 
process (limit other access to 
your resources) and protecting
ressources from your process. 

security policy defines the rules: some
statement of secure procedure or configuration
that parameterizes the operation of a system.

a policy is a set of acceptable
behaviors. 

`Check whether a process is authorized to
perform operations on an object`.

Object + operations = permission

Set of permissions generally defines the
access control policy. 

**Protection domain**: describes all permissions
that are available to a particular domain. 

access matrix is represented either
as an access control lists, or as 
capabilities
