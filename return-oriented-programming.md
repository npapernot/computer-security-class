# Return-oriented programming

Two steps in control flow exploitation: 

1. attacker gets control of program flow.
For instance return address or function 
pointer. This can be done using vulnerabilities
like stack (buffer), heap, format string.

2. attacker uses control to launch attacks.
This can be done using code injection (e.g.,
on stakc or other data region).
